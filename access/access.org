*#+title: Learning Microsoft Access

* Access vs Excel
** Access
*** Great at: Relational Data
**** Multiple tables with related information
** Excel
*** Great at: Analyzing flat structure data
** Not Interchangeable
* Learning Strategies
** Play with other people's databases
*** Microsoft sample databases:
**** https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/featured-access-templates-e14f25e4-78b6-41de-8278-1afcfc91a9cb?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us
***** [[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/results.aspx?qu=database#ai:TC001228997%7C][Northwinds Database is widely known]]
** Tutorial Series
*** [[http://www.utteraccess.com/uploads/Crystal/][Crystal's Access Basics]]
*** [[http://access.mvps.org/access/tencommandments.htm][Ten Commandments of Access]]
**** Print these and display where you will see them whenever working with Access
**** Breaking any of these is a recipe for failure

* Basic Steps to Create a Database
** 1. Planning phase of carefully reviewing the database design
*** Proceed Carefully
**** Follow a naming convention
**** Get the table structures and relationships correct
*** Poor planning will result in an inflexible database that doesn't adapt to changes
*** Articles to guide through the planning process:

** 2. Add common tables, modules, and classes
*** Called a shell database
*** Examples:
**** [[http://allenbrowne.com/ser-23a.html][Error Tracking]]
**** Message Box Generation
***** From an article: "I copied a technique from the Northwinds database to simplify generating message boxes. I wouldn't really bother with this in the beginning."
**** [[http://access.mvps.org/access/api/api0008.htm][Current User]]
**** [[http://allenbrowne.com/ser-42.html][ELookup]]
***** Replaces DLookup
**** etc...
***** Anything you find that you frequently need.
** 3. Populate reference tables
*** These are tables that house repetitive information that are created to avoid sotring duplicate information.
**** Example: All 50 US States.
** 4. Add Forms for data Entry
*** Three Common Form Types
**** Details
***** Display details for an entry
***** Main hub to edit details for a piece of information
****** ie: Personal data cards for contacts
***** [[https://imgur.com/5GGOAAz][Example 1]]
***** [[https://imgur.com/FwZ9nSe][Example 2]]
**** Split Sheet
***** Display, search, filter data
***** "Looks and feels" like a spreadsheet
****** Users can't directly interact with tables
******* Commandment 1
****** Clicking on entries opens detail form for that record
***** [[https://imgur.com/BFZnPmC][Example]]
**** Dialog
***** Provides clickable links to navigate various forms/reports of the database
****** ie: dashboards that load on opening or dialog boxes to print customized reports
***** [[https://imgur.com/dEoECaj][Example 1]]
***** [[https://imgur.com/NZKZW9P][Example 2]]
*** Use the Form Wizard in the beginning but you will find it easier to make your own as you learn more and get comfortable with Access.
**** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3WHo7DAOg0][Video about form creation]]
** 5. Add Reports
*** Two broad categories
**** Individual
***** Print specific record
**** Group
***** Print out big summaries
** 6. Customize
*** Some ideas
**** Link things to Excel for data analysis and graphing data.
**** Email automation
**** Use addresses to print labels/envelopes
**** Logon form
* Primary Keys
** Use Auto-Numbers
** Users should never interact with primary keys to prevent accidental changes
* Naming Conventions
** Anything logical and consistent is fine
** One technique is to use a short prefix with an underscore followed by a logical name:
*** Tables would be: tbl_People or tblPeople
*** Queries would be: qry_MemberDetails or qryMemberDetails
*** Use descriptive field names, be a specific as you can, characters are cheap
**** Instead of FirstName, use ClientFirstName or EmployeeFirstName
* Split Databases
** Standard Practice

* Front End Distribution
** Article: [[https://www.devhut.net/2015/06/30/ms-access-deploying-your-database-front-end-to-your-users/][Deploying and Updating Front End Database Applications]]
* Queries
** Filter data so you only see what you are interested in
