SETUP:
  Rails:
    rails new myapp --database=postgresql
      This creates the app and prepares it for postgres.
      /config/database.yml is where you can modify DB setup
	When this file is setup to your liking (defaults work and will setup a DB called myapp_development/test/etc)
	  run:
	    rake db:setup or rails db:setup
	      This creates the databases, sets the users according to the .yml file, and creates the schema_migrations tables which 
	      records your migrations to schemas and data.
