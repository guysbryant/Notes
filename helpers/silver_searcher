Like ack but faster and can be told to use .gitignore and .hgignore ontop of .ignore
	- This makes finding your files faster because it doesn't seach EVERYTHING
	- Suggested to add *.min.js to .ignore
Usage:
	ag todo
	ag [string to search for] [file]
	[output stream] | ag [string to search for]
Result:
	Find every file that contains the word todo
