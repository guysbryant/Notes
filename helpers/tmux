tmux to start
resize with M-[arrow keys] || mouse

s - Lists all sessions and lets you pick one to switch to
z - full screen(full window really) for current pane
? - List all keys/options

Layout switching:
M-{
 1: even-horizontal,
 2: even-vertical,
 3: main-horizontal,
 4: main-vertical,
 5: tiled
}


See ~/.tmux.conf for my customizations

Notably:
- VIM style pane switching with C[h,j,k,l]
- C-a replaces C-b as leader
- splits (all start with leader):
	- by default tmux creates a new split using the directory you started the tmux session from
		- - for horizontal
		- = for vertical
	- using M (this is alt/option) and the split keys, I can create a split using the current directory of the pane I split from 
- new window
	- 
- leader r
	- loads tmux config changes into a currently running tmux session
